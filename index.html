  <h1>Hello World! Welcome to Austin Silano's website</h1>

<h4>Projects:</h4>
<p>A big portion of learning in IT is applying your skills to projects that you can build/deploy yourself. I have a homelab that I use to practice my networking, sysadmin, and cybersecurity skills. </p>
<strong> What have I deployed? </strong>
<p>Publically Accessible Proxmox server:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://proxmox.liliumsecurity.com/">Proxmox Server</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My hypervisor is deployed on the internet where I can access and work on my practice vms from anywhere I want. Note: This does not use my public IP, so you cannot ddos it in the traditional sense. </p>
<p>Wazuh Server:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://wazuh.liliumsecurity.com">Wazuh</a></li>
</ul>
<p> This is my Wazuh manager I have deployed as my EDR and SIEM for my devices and VMs. </p>
<P> Sheet2Bitwarden:</P>
<ul> 
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Lilium48/Sheet2Bitwarden">Sheet2Bitwarden</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Python-based project that allows the user to import all usernames and passwords from Google Docs to Bitwarden.</p>

<h5 style="font-size: 16px;">Projects in the Works:</h5>
I have the following projects in the making: 
<ul>
  <li>Pyzuh- Python based project that will allow the user to better interact with the Wazuh API. Similar to Spotipy.</li>
  <li>NextProxy- Proxy server written in Rust, still WIP but can find it on my Github. </li>
  <li>SpotiFilter- Allows the User to filter songs based on certain parameters that are set by the User. </li>
  <li>Network/Cybersecurity lab- Planning on redeploying my lab to Cisco and other enterprise gear for hardware, while adding more Network/Cybersecurity-based software such as TheHive, Elastic, and Prometheus.</li>
  </ul>
